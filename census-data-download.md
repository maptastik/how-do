# Filtering US Census data for download

The website for the US Census is a mess. Tabs on data, download, and geography seem to suggest you can get the raw data, albeit filtered by topic and geography, with relative ease. Nope. If you want the Decennial census, American Community Survey, or other estimate data, the key is [American Fact Finder](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml).

1. Go to [factfinder.census.gov](http://factfinder.census.gov/)
2. Navigate to `Download Center`. Click. Go through the steps which are awesome for filtering data OMG WHY ISN'T THIS JUST THE MAIN CENSUS SITE IN THE FIRST PLACE!
